Hi

I am trying to figure out which model checker would be the most appropriate for checking the properies that we wish to investigate.

Spin was used for the model I wrote for the dissertation. Spin is designed to focus on checking interprocess communication and checking the state space to see if a property holds, or does not hold. If we are trying to find out whether having both the 5HTR1 and the 5HTR2, or just the 5HTR2, will generally be more successful, I don't think this model checker will be appropriate.


Prism is a probablablistic model checker. We can use this to determine the probablility of certain outcomes occurring in a system. We can use this to find out whether the Nutt hypothesis or your hypothesis is more likely to produce a better result.

an example is linked here:

Uppaal allows us to include the concept of time in our model by using logical clocks. I am unsure of how important time will be in our model. Uppaal can also model probabilities.

here is a simple example:

I think that either Prism or Uppaal would be appropriate for developin the model. If you have any thoughts on which model checker I should use, let me know!
