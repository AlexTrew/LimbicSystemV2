vis1: visual signal from gap.
vis2: visual signal from food.
noise: exploration
Pyrimadal cortical neuron: receives excitatatory GLU from visual inputs. inhibited by interneuron (are interneuron and inhibitary neuron the same thing?)
interneuron: inhibitory neuron
action selection a:

5HT: serotonin
Gaba: inhibits the neuron
Glu: glutamate; excites pyramidal neuron. (acts via standard ampa receptors)

AMPA- standard brain receptor

5HTR1: receptor t 1; dexcreases membrane potential towards the resting potential of the neuron. makes harder the neuron to fire.

5HTR2: receptor t 2; increases membrane potential similar to GLU. help pyramidal neuron to fire.


hypothesis 1: seratonin is associated with focus and sticking to a plan. 5HT. we want to include both 5HTR1 and 5HTR2 receptors. 

hypothesis 2: only 5HTR2 receptors. 

questions:

is step 2, does the seratonin make the animal wait? 


design ideas:

each neuron a process sending and reciving 5HT etc via channels. 

could express equation using weird float system or something else.

uppaal

would likely be better to go with SMC then EMC, so we should either use prism or uppaal. investigate time component of uppaal.

DO PRISM STUFF
do uppaal

ask william for help with prism

in model, forget the threshold; use speed. low a -> low speed
